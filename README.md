# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository is a collection of my solutions to various LeetCode problems. I use this space to document my problem-solving journey, improve my coding skills, and share my approaches with others.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- **Track Progress**: Keep a record of my solutions to LeetCode problems.
- **Improve Skills**: Practice and refine my problem-solving and coding abilities.
- **Share Knowledge**: Provide clear and well-documented solutions for others to learn from.
- **Prepare for Interviews**: Prepare for technical interviews by solving a wide range of algorithmic and data structure problems.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- Each problem has its own folder, named after the problem title or ID.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - A solution file (e.g., `solution.cpp`, `solution.py`, etc.).
  - A `README.md` file explaining the problem, my approach, and the time and space complexity of the solution.
- Problems are categorized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Trees, etc.) for easier navigation.

## Languages

I primarily use the following programming languages for my solutions:
- **C**
- **C++**
- **Python**

Feel free to explore solutions in your preferred language!
